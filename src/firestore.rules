/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for AlgoGenius platform.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user-related data,
 * and public read access for system-generated scenarios. Write access is
 * carefully controlled to ensure data integrity and prevent unauthorized
 * modifications. Authorization is primarily achieved through path-based
 * ownership, avoiding costly `get()` calls where possible, but allowing them
 * for specific, secure cross-user lookups (like an educator reading a student's profile).
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user account information and profile data. Document ID is the userId.
 * - /users/{userId}/students/{studentId}: An educator's roster of students. The studentId is the student's UID.
 * - /users-by-email/{email}: Maps user emails to UIDs for secure lookups.
 * - /scenarios/{scenarioId}: Stores system-generated programming scenarios, publicly readable.
 * - /users/{userId}/assignments/{assignmentId}: Stores assignments assigned to a user.
 * - /educators/{educatorId}/submissions/{submissionId}: Denormalized submissions for easy querying.
 * - /scenarios/{scenarioId}/hints/{hintId}: Stores hints related to a specific scenario.
 * - /scenarios/{scenarioId}/testCases/{testCaseId}: Stores test cases for a specific scenario.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read/write their own user and profile data.
 * - **Exception**: An educator can read a student's profile if that user's role is 'student'.
 * - `users-by-email` allows any authenticated user to find a student's UID by email.
 * - Scenarios are publicly readable, but write access is restricted.
 * - Assignments are owned by the student.
 * - Listing all users is disallowed for security reasons.
